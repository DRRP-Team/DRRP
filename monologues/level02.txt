Someone changed
the code on this
door without
telling me. The
new code may have
something to do
with the layout
of these tunnels.
I wish I had an
automap.

I don't know the
code! See if you
can figure it out
by looking at
your automap.

The supervisors
in this area have
been acting weird
lately. It might
have something to
do with that high
level guy that's
been coming
around.

I'll stay here
and see what else
has been changed.

Oh, God! You
startled me! Can
you get us out of
this? My mainte-
nance passcode is
042. Use it to
access terminals
in the off-site
backup room.

Please, hurry! Go
to the off-site
backup room and
find the mainte-

Marine, is that
you? It's Dr.
Guerard. I may be
able to send you
information as
you make your way
through the base,
so be sure to be
on the lookout
for my messages
on computer ter-
minals. Looks
like you'll have
to get through
Ore Processing to
get out of the
sector you're in
now. There, I've
unlocked the en-
trance door for
you.

Get moving! Head
back to Ore Proc-
essing.

Sorry I missed
your birthday.
Can't get any

but I think
you'll like what
I got. Left it in
the other hidden

It's just inside
Ore Processing.

We're in serious
trouble, Marine!
This processor
looks like it's
going to overload
and take down the
whole power grid
for this sector.
Let me think for
a moment...

Get 10 armor
points and give
them to the
scientist.

Yes! I think I
can use the alloy
in your armor
shards to cause a
local short to
avert the over-
load. Ten should
do it. [Engage
scientist again
to give him 10
armor shards]

You don't have
enough armor
shards. Try to
find some more
around here.
Hurry! We don't
have much time.

Access panel code
is 988.

OK, I've got your
shards. Now use
the computer in
the alcove by the
entrance to open
the access panel
and I'll insert
the alloy. The
computer should
be finished with
its backup by
now. The panel
access code is
988.

988 should be the
panel access
code.

All right, Ma-
rine, I've gone
through the ac-
cess panel and am
inside the proc-
essor now. Come
back to the proc-
essor; I may need
some help.

I'm about done
placing the
shards... hey, I
thought this
problem was
caused by the in-
vasion but on
closer look, it
looks like

Log Entry of
Dr. Jensen:
*CLASSIFIED*
An Information
Security staffer
came in the other
day for an audit
of the lab. It's
strange... I've
been with UAC's
Advanced Research
Department for
over 7 years and
this is a first.

Log Entry of
Dr. Jensen:

Woot! Going to
New Vegas for my
day off. I'm down
500 UAC credits
for the year but
I'll make it up!

Log Entry of
Dr. Jensen:
*CLASSIFIED*
I don't trust Dr.
Guerard. I saw
him put a handful
of Hydrocon vials
into his lab
coat. I've re-
ported the activ-
ity to personnel
but nothing has
come of it. The
recent lab audits
indicate we're
losing a lot of
supplies and I
don't want the
blamed for Mr.
Sticky Fingers!
