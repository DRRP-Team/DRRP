[Dr. Kelvin]
Hello again. You
here for the red
keycard? The
passages to the
rest of the sec-
tor have caved
in, but I can
help you get
through. I'll un-
lock the door.
Come on, I'll
show you.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Come on through
the door to your
left.

[Dr. Kelvin]
This is one of
the first matter
transportation
units built on
the base. I can
send you through
to its counter-
part at the other
end of the lab.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Step into the
unit in the mid-
dle of this room
and I'll trans-
port you. You'll
instantly be sent
to its counter-
part unit.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Something seems
to have gone very
wrong. You didn't
rematerialize in
the other tele-
portation unit,
and worse, none
of your weapons
rematerialized
with you! I don't
have to tell you
to use extreme
caution. I think
I can unlock that
door. Yes, try it
now.

Whoa! I can't
talk now... some-
thing's coming!

From: J. LaGrave
Did you go out
and check on that
sensor array? I'm
still getting
wacky readings. I
think something's
busted out there.

[Email]

From: R. Williams
Checked the ar-
ray. Everything
passed my diag-
nostics. But the
readings don't
seem to make
sense to me ei-
ther. I'm working
with Lloyd to try
to find out
what's going on.

No more email.

Error....#$^@%*#^

Use passcode 666
for the door
ahead.

Red keycard in
northeast corner
of this sector.

Ahh... when I saw
those weapons
come through the
teleporter with-
out their owner,
I knew something
was wrong. Look-
ing at these
data, it seems
like someone
deliberately sab-
otaged your tele-
port. Here, I
think you'll need
these!
[You got your
weapons back]
If you're looking
for the red key-
card, try the
northeast corner
of this sector.
I've just enabled
the cycle oper-
ation on the door
up ahead. The
code is 666.

I'm going to stay
here and try to
make sense of
these other sen-
sor readings. It
looks to me like
the reactor is
back online, and
there are huge
power draws all
over the base. I
think something
big is about to
happen.

Code 666 should
work for the door
ahead.

New message
arriving...

Attn. all person-
nel: If you can
use a terminal
with access to
your local sensor
array, check your
readings now.
We're sensing a
rise in the same
readings that
preceded the at-
tack wave. Report
if you can.

Too many users...
blah blah blah.

few seconds...

Can anyone hear
me?! All hell is
breaking loose!
They're in Junc-

where! Everyone's
dead. They're
hoarding out of
the reactor sec-
tor! If anyone
can hear this...
please help!

Connection lost..

Oh, man! I
thought you were
one of those
things! I barely
made it out of
Junction when
that second wave
hit. The rest of
my unit didn't
make it.

Just before we
got hit, someone
screamed that the
gates of Hell had
opened. After
seeing all
these...demons,
or whatever they
are, I believe
it.

Find the red
keycard.

You're definitely
going to need the
red keycard if
you want to get
anywhere up
ahead. You'd bet-
ter go find it.

Look, I'm almost
out of ammo and
armor. I can't do
you much good.
I'm going to stay
here and see what
I can scrounge.
