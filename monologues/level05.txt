I've set up a new
passcode on Door
09 that exits
this area. You'll
need to access
the computer lo-
cated in a room
west of this po-
sition to open
the door.

Hey genius, you

Oh right. The
code is 675...
uh, I can't re-

I'll reset it to

remember first

Jensen has the
blue keycard.

Huh? What!?! I'm
awake! Oh, hey
Marine. What
brings you here?
The blue keycard?
Dr. Jensen was
carrying it as he
was being hauled
away. Not sure
where they took
him.

What was Jensen
doing here any-
way? Wasn't he
fired weeks ago?

Get the passcode
database.

There's a room up
ahead that has a
database of pass-
codes used in
this sector.
You'd probably
find it helpful.

Ok, move along
now. I'm going
back to sleep.

Zzz...

Zzz.. Wha? Oh,
you again. What?!
You need help
with a database?
Well, everything
I know I learned
from an online
tutorial. Let me
pull it up here
on this computer.
Ok, done. Use the
computer to the
left to teach
yourself database
administration.

Hrm. It looks
like part of the
file is cor-
rupted. Oh well.
You already know
enough to do ba-
sics like re-
trieving data.

System offline.

I learned how to
use databases.

The SELECT state-
ment is used to
acquire data from
a table in a da-
tabase, basic
syntax is as fol-
lows: SELECT col-
umn_names FROM
table_name. More
advanced usage of
the SELECT state-
ment is covered
in later chap-
ters.

Jeez, I think I'm

wife was here,
she'd ask someone
for directions.

What I'd give for
an automap about
now.

I hate maze dun-
geons!

What's next?
Jumping puzzles?
Scavenger hunts?
Backtracking with
new enemies?
Sheesh. Just
gimme a BFG and
let me go postal
on some imp
hordes.

The computer on
the left has a
database with all
the passcodes for
the doors in this
area. It needs a
passcode which
is... uh...

I hope you have
some database
skills, 'cause
you are gonna
have to do some
hardcore SQL
hacking to find
the database of
passcodes on the
computer!

Database login
passcode might be
4453.

Let me know if
you figure out
how to get the
passcodes. So far
all I've been
able to do is get
the database
login passcode
which is 4453...
I think.

Talk to sleepy
scientist to
learn how to use
databases.

If you need help
with SQL syntax
issues go talk to
Johnson. He's a
scientist working
down here. He
sleeps on the
job, but he is a
pro with data-
bases. He can
probably help
you.

That was some way
awesome hacking,
man.

Marine! It's me,
Dr. Jensen! You
gotta help me!

[Dr. Jensen]
UAC security
locked me up for
snooping around
the data center.
Please find a way
to get me out of
here!

[Dr. Jensen]
Guerard is going
to do something
terrible! I found
some troubling
facts prior to
being thrown in
here. Please, get
me out!

[Dr. Jensen]
There's a com-
puter terminal
around here that
can unlock the
door. Find it.

Hey, what're you
in for? Me?
Stealing. Turns
out petty theft
can get you up to
3 years in this
joint.

You've come to
free us? I don't
really have any-
where to go so I
guess I'll just
stay here.

Are you sure you
should be talking
to a thief? I
can't resist the
urge to take
things.

I'm not sure why
I take things...
I just feel an
urge to steal. I
need therapy, not
prison!

If this is my
fate, so be it!

You are freeing
us?! Thank you!
Uh... I guess I
should give you
these back...

Received 20 UAC
credits.

I'm free!

Get the stuff
from the Secure
Closet. Passcode
is 648.

[Dr. Jensen]
Thanks for your
help. When I got
caught they took
my weapon and my
blue keycard and
put them in the
Secure Closet. I
saw them set the
passcode to
648.

[Dr. Jensen]
Get my equipment
from the Secure
Closet and I'll
log onto one of
the computers and
continue my in-
vestigation.
Something terri-
ble is about to
happen and Gue-
rard's behind it.

[Dr. Jensen]
I'm pretty sure
the Secure Closet
code is 648. I
watched them set
the code after
they detained me.

Meet back up with
Jensen at the
computer.

Keep the keycard
and rocket
launcher. You'll
need them more
than me. I've
found some more
information on
this computer...

There's recent
communication
from Dr. Guerard
to Mr. Nadira.
Nadira is ordered
to meet up with
Guerard in the
Power Control
Room in Sector 6.
He mentioned
something about
"big plans"...

Exit to the west
of the prison.

I think Guerard
has been using
Nadira's mind
control equipment
to influence peo-
ple at UAC ad-
ministration and
it looks like
both may be work-
ing for Kronos.

Ok, I got the
door out of here
unlocked. Get
back to Junction
through the exit
west of the
prison. We'll
meet up in Sector
6. We must find
out what Guerard
is up to.

Proceed to Junc-
tion through the
exit west of the
prison. I'll meet
up with you in
the next sector.

Be on the lookout
for an ex-
employee seen
snooping around
the base. His
name is Dr. Jen-
sen. Detain him
if he's found.

We found Jensen
in the data cen-
ter trying to ac-
cess email logs.
He's being held
in cell 42-A in
the Sector 5
Brig. He was
armed with a roc-
ket launcher and
had a blue key-
card. What's all
this about?
-Francis

[Email]
To: F. Eckle
From: Col. Graff
Excellent work!
Jensen was fired.
We found a bunch
of stolen equip-
ment in a make-
shift laboratory
in Sector 4 and
we suspect Jen-
sen. The esteemed
Dr. Guerard will
need to have a
"chat" with Jen-
sen later to in-
vestigate the
matter. What's
the passcode to
the cell?
-Col. Graff

Prison cell pass-
code is 229.

[Email]
To: Col. Graff
From: F. Eckle
Glad we caught
the thief. The
prison passcode
is 229.
-Francis

There is a hidden
door called Door
55 in Sector 2.
Use passcode 5555
to unlock Door
55.
