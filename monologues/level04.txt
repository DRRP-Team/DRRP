hurt.

I warned you. Now
you die! Cacode-
mon, kill! [A

Please, don't
hurt me! I'll

thing...

MUAHAHAHA!

GoodDoc99: Ma-
rine, it's Dr.
Guerard. You may
have stumbled
upon a secret re-
search facility
inside an old
section of the
base. We think
Dr. Jensen has
been storing sto-
len supplies
there.

[INSTANT MESSAGE]
GoodDoc99: Re-
frain from look-
ing around the
lab. We need to
get an investiga-
tion team there
to search for
evidence and I
don't want the
area contami-
nated.

[INSTANT MESSAGE]
GoodDoc99: I've
unlocked the door
leading out of
the old base to
Junction. Proceed
forward with your
mission and we'll
take care of re-
covering the sto-
len lab supplies.
Guerard out.

Welcome! This is
the oldest part
of the base.
Built in 2112,
the surrounding
structures and
tunnels made up
UAC's first per-
manent Martian
settlement. This
area is now only
used to store
hazardous waste.

We've been having
computer prob-
lems. The latest
glitch has locked
our main door out
of here back to
Junction. Maybe
you can help us
get it open.

Go talk to Dr.
Kelvin, he's
working on the
computer trying
to get the door
open. The door is
down the hall on
the right.

This is stupid!
It'll never work.

What'd I tell ya?

Blip, bleep...
BEEWOOOP. WHONK
WHONK!

HAHAHA! You
thought you could
blow me up?!?!

[Dr. Kelvin]
The damn door is
locked and this
controller is to-
tally borked! I
have never, in my
23 years with the
UAC, seen this
error before.

[Dr. Kelvin]
PC Load Letter?
What on Mars?!
Sorry, my name is
Dr. Kelvin. I was
sent to fix the
computer problems
when these
strange creatures
appeared out of
nowhere and
killed most of my
staff. As you can
see, I'm a bit on
edge.

Talk to Jenkins.

[Dr. Kelvin]
I've had it with
this machine!
Jenkins's looking
for some explo-
sives to blow
this sucker open.
Why don't you
make yourself
useful and see if
he needs any
help.

[Jenkins]
I love big explo-
sions but, jeez,
why do *I* have
to move the bar-
rels? Dr. Kelvin
never does any of
the hard work
around here!

[Jenkins]
I can handle it.
Check if Dr. Kel-
vin needs help.

Get medical sup-
plies at the med
lab.

[Jenkins]
Dr. Kelvin says
we need to blow
open the locked
door so I'm to
take the explo-
sive barrels from
storage and put
them in front of
the door. Should
be cool. Why
don't you go to
the old med lab
to stock up on
medical sup-
plies... just in
case. I unlocked
the lab door a
moment ago.

[Jenkins]
Go to the med lab
and stock up on
medical supplies!
We may need them
if the explosion
goes bad.

[Jenkins]
I don't need any
help with the
barrels. I should
have them moved
by the time you
get back.

Welcome to the
old Medical Lab.
We keep the
medical supplies
in the back room.
I think we have a
Flack Jacket and
a couple of Med-
kits.

Dr. Kelvin wants
to blow up the
door with explo-
sives? Why am I
not surprised?
He's wanted that
door open for
days.

I just hope no
one gets hurt
when they ignite
the explosives.

Good luck with
the door blast-
ing. Try not to
hurt yourself.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Damn! The explo-
sion didn't even
scratch the door.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Whoa! I just saw
someone appear in
front of the door
controls. Is that
Dr. Guerard? I
could swear he
wasn't here a
second ago!

[Dr. Kelvin]
Hey, go talk to
Dr. Guerard.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Thank goodness
for Dr. Guerard!
I still don't
know where he
came from but he
unlocked the door
and that's all I
need to know!

[Dr. Guerard]
Hello again, Ma-
rine. Seems like
you need help
with this door. I
think I've found
the problem.
There, fixed...
the door is un-
locked.

[Dr. Guerard]
No need to thank
me. Just doing my
job.

[Dr. Guerard]
Don't concern
yourself with how
I got the door
opened. Just move
on with your mis-
sion.

[Jenkins]
Doesn't seem like
the explosion did
anything, but it
was still pretty
sweet!

[Jenkins]
Next time we'll
use more barrels.

[Jenkins]
I don't trust
Dr. Guerard. How
did he get here
and how did he
open the door?

[Dr. Kelvin]
Jenkins lined up
the barrels so
you can shoot the
end barrel. This
should cause a
chain reaction
and blow open the
door.

[Dr. Kelvin]
You have the hon-
ors. Fire at one
of the barrels on
the end and it
should blow them
all up. Maintain
a safe distance
so we don't get
hurt.

[Jenkins]
I'm done moving
the barrels. I've
arranged them so
that when the end
barrel is shot,
they'll all ex-
plode and hope-
fully blow open
that door.

[Jenkins]
You can set them
off by shooting
the end barrel.

[Jenkins]
Let 'er rip, man!
Shoot those
barrels and light
up this cave!
