[Dr. Jensen]
I'm just checking
some things on
this terminal.
I'm OK; I don't
need any help.

[Dr. Jensen]
Look, I was un-
justly fired re-
cently and I have
a hunch it may
have something to
do with what's
happening around
here. I'm just
trying to find
some things
out.

[Dr. Jensen]
You should just
keep moving.
There's nothing
you can do to
help me right
now.

I'm Dr. Guerard.
Are you the Ma-
rine sent to help
us? Well, I need
you to figure out
a sequence to get
the door out of
this area un-
locked. Things
are really
screwed up and I
need to get back
to my experiments
to make sure the
power losses
haven't caused
any problems!

Use trial and
error to unlock
the doors in the
main corridor.

[Dr. Guerard]
Figure out the
sequence to get
that door un-
locked. Use trial
and error.

Ask the civilian
about a door
passcode.

[Dr. Guerard]
Hello again.
A door north of
this position
leads back to
Junction, but it
is locked. Ask
that guy if he
has the code for
door.

[Dr. Guerard]
Try to get the
passcode for the
door out of that
civilian worker.

[Dr. Guerard]
He said I have
the code? I've
never even been
down here until
the invasion! Try
offering him some
credits; he might
be more helpful.

Offer the civil-
ian credits for
the code.

[Dr. Guerard]
Offer that man
some credits for
the passcode.

That guy is sup-
posedly a high-
level scientist
but he doesn't
have any pass-
codes? BS! If
he's so high
level, he must
have some codes
to help us get
back to Junction.

Ask the scientist
for codes.

See if you can...
uh, see if you
can get any codes
from that scien-
tist. He should
have some.

Scientist. Codes.
Go!

OK, maybe I have
a code that can
help you, but how
are you going to
help me? How
about I give you
my passcode for
10 credits?
[Engage civilian
again to give him
10 UAC credits]

You don't even
have enough
credits to talk
to me, jar head.
I suggest you
start looking
around for some.

Thanks, uh, skip-
per or whatever
you are. I don't
want that scien-
tist to hear the
code so I'll just
write it down in
your notebook...
There. I... uh...
whoa! What the
hell is happening
to me?!

Use passcode 225
on north door.

I changed the se-

I don't know when
your birthday is!

Door passcode
somehow related
to October 10th.

Is that why I
didn't get a gift
last year? I'd
really like a
X-Cube 46.
P.S. - I was born
October 10, 2114.

[Dr. Guerard]
You look like you
could use some
help. Here's some
extra health to
get you ready for
whatever lies
ahead!

[Dr. Guerard]
It's not impor-
tant how I got
here ahead of
you. It's best
you just keep
moving.

[Dr. Guerard]
Please, just
keep moving.

You'll find use-
ful equipment be-
hind this door
but you need the
green keycard to
get in. Come back
here when you get
the green key-
card.

Having trouble
finding the green
keycard? You
won't find it in
this sector.
You'll likely
find the green
keycard in a
later sector.
You'll need to
travel back here
to open this
door.

You can re-enter
this sector from
Junction even af-
ter successfully
completing it. By
revisiting pre-
viously completed
sectors you can
uncover addition-
al secrets and
build strength by
acquiring equip-
ment and fighting
monsters.
