Welcome to Junc-
tion, Marine.
Most of the peo-
ple that survived
the attack have
regrouped here.

Dr. Jensen got
canned due to
some security
issues. I'm not
sure what that
was all about.

I used to work
with Mr. Nadira
in bioresearch.
He was a nice
guy, until he
started working
with Dr. Guerard.

We're screwed. It
is only a matter
of time before
the monsters
enter Junction.

Junction is an
area that inter-
connects the dif-
ferent areas of
the base. The
corridors and
doors in Junction
lead to all the
major sectors
within this fa-
cility. Some pas-
sages in Junction
are locked and
require high-
level security
clearance to en-
ter.

You be careful.

Ever heard of
Kronos? Never met
him but logs show
he has extremely
high security
clearance.

Hold me!

You can acquire
supplies and
medical treatment
here. Inquire
with the north
wing staff for
more information.

This door leads
to the reactor
powering this fa-
cility. Top-level
security clear-
ance is required
to enter this
area.

It's my duty to
guard this post.
Orders from UAC
HQ.

I can't let you
in without proper
credentials.

Sorry, under or-
ders. No go with-
out proper clear-
ance.

No.

You really want
in? How about we
make a deal? Got
100 UAC credits?

No deal. Changed
my mind. Get the
red keycard if
you want in.

Use the computer
to the left to
purchase sup-
plies.

Find UAC credits
lying round the
base and use them
to purchase use-
ful provisions at
Junction.

Many of the items
found around this
base are self-
explanatory, but
a few require ex-
planation. The
Soul Sphere re-
stores your armor
and health to
maximum. The Ber-
serker increases
your attack
briefly. These
are one-time use
items.

You can buy stat
boosters at a
vending machine
computer. These
increase your De-
fense, Agility,
Strength, and Ac-
curacy. Defense
is your resis-
tance to attacks.
Agility is your
ability to evade
attacks. Strength
is the damage you
can inflict. Ac-
curacy is your
ability to land
an attack.

Seems stupid for
the UAC to be
charging a Marine
for combat equip-
ment.

I'm a doctor, re-
lax. I'll dress
your wounds.

Health restored.

Feeling better?

Come see me any
time you need
medical atten-
tion.

Use the Medkits
in your inventory
if you're hurt
during combat.

Sorry Marine,
this area is off
limits. Dr. Gue-
rard ordered a
quarantine of
the reactor area.

This passage
leads to Sector
2. You are wel-
come to try it
out but you
should probably
try playing
through Sector 1
first.

This passage
leads to Sector
3. You should
consider complet-
ing Sector 2 be-
fore entering
Sector 3. But
hey, do whatever
you want.

Don't know why
but my col-
leagues, Dr. Jen-
sen and Dr. Gue-
rard, have it out
for each other. I
don't trust ei-
ther of them!

I heard Dr. Gue-
rard got Dr. Jen-
sen fired. Not
sure I believe
that though. I
think Jensen was
just sloppy with
his security pro-
cedures.

Kronos is going
to kill us all!

Rumor is that
Jensen was fired
for security
breaches but
Guerard may have
had something to
do with it.

Have you met Kro-
nos? I've been
here for years
but have never
met him.

Lots of equipment
has disappeared.
Hope it turns up
intact.

The scientists at
this facility are
insane!

Oh, you have the
blue keycard?
Jensen had it
when we arrested
him. Hope Guerard
doesn't come
looking for it.

Someone told me
they saw Guerard
transform into
some kind of hor-
rible creature. I
wonder what that
is all about.

I don't know who
to trust anymore.

I won't tell any-
one you have the
card. I don't
trust Guerard.
I'd rather you
have it than him.

I'm beginning to
wonder if anyone
will make it out
of here alive.

I was working in
Sector 5 as part
of the unit that
arrested Dr. Jen-
sen. I remember
he was fired sev-
eral weeks ago so
I'm not sure why
he's still at
this facility.

I need to get
into the green
zone but I mis-
placed my green
keycard.

You found my
green keycard!
Keep it. You need
it more than I
do.

I'm freaked. I
have a feeling
something really
bad is about to
happen.

Guerard went down
to the reactor. I
hope he can put
an end to this
invasion!

I think I left my
green keycard in
Sector 3, in the
yellow zone.

Good luck,
Marine.

I can't get
through the green
door without my
green keycard.

You have yellow
security clear-
ance. Proceed
through the
yellow door.

I worked with
Guerard and
Jensen on the
teleportation re-
search team.
Those two really
have it out for
each other.

My feet hurt from
standing here so
long.

I have a really
bad feeling about
Guerard. Between
us, I think he
is the one re-
sponsible for
this mess.

Search the base
for additional
colored keycards
which allow ac-
cess to more ar-
eas in Junction.

Jensen got fired
over a security
matter. Rumor is
that Guerard got
him fired though
Jensen did noth-
ing wrong. I
don't believe it.
Dr. Guerard was
an outstanding
employee, putting
in extra hours at
night and be-
friending UAC ad-
ministrators.
He's a nice guy.

The red keycard
is the highest
level of security
clearance - it
allows access to
the reactor area
which houses the
power plant pro-
viding energy to
the entire facil-
ity.

I heard Jensen is
still on base in-
vestigating his
firing. Hope he
uncovers the
truth.

These doors lead
to various areas
of the base. In
each subsequent
sector the jour-
ney gets harder.
Since the more
you fight the
stronger you get,
stick to the easy
areas first.

Seems you've
cleared Sector 3
and acquired a
green keycard.
Continue your
mission by head-
ing to the green
zone and clearing
Sectors 4 and 5.

We won't make it
much longer. It's
only a matter of
time before the
monsters enter
Junction.

I heard Nadira
got eaten by a
monster. No loss.
I never liked
the guy.

You will be taken
back to Junction
should you get
incapacitated
during combat.

Not sure how long
we'll last here
at Junction. Mon-
sters have taken
over every other
part of the base
and we need sup-
plies.

You can replay a
sector several
times to build up
your abilities.

Good to see you
made it. Your
current objective
is to seek infor-
mation on the
cause of this in-
vasion and find a
way to stop it.

I don't trust
Guerard and I
don't think you
should either.
I've heard that
he's working with
Kronos and that
they're responsi-
ble for this
mess.

It's only a mat-
ter of time be-
fore the demons
overrun the en-
tire planet...

What? The main
reactor is back
online? I hope
they aren't
planning on re-
opening the por-
tal.

You'll need addi-
tional colored
keycards to gain
access to all the
areas accessible
from Junction.

Trust your in-
stincts. It's the
only way to sur-
vive.

Bioscans indicate
the monsters are
coming from the
underground reac-
tor sector.
Strange... how
could they be in-
vading from a
geothermic reac-
tor deep inside a
Martian cavern?

You know what to
expect: more sec-
tor doors to ex-
plore in the hunt
for the next col-
ored keycard. Get
to it!

A lot of the sci-
entists look EX-
ACTLY like me.
Why you may ask?
Is this outpost
some cloning fa-
cility or are the
game designers
too lazy to cre-
ate a variety of
characters? Or is
it something more
insidious, like
extremely small
memory con-
straints for
portable devices
that won't allow
much graphical
variety?!

Have you noticed
that if you keep
talking to people
here they make
trite inside
jokes and other
misguided at-
tempts at humor?

Ever hear of Kro-
nos? He was a UAC
scientist working
on teleportation
research years
ago. It's said
that he traveled
from our dimen-
sion to one of
pure evil where
he fused human
technology with
demonic flesh,
creating a new
super weapon. UAC
fired Kronos and
buried the re-
search but rumor
has it that
Kronos is on this
base trying to
bring his crea-
tion into our di-
mension.

If you come
across him, stop
him. Be careful,
Kronos is con-
trolling the
minds of UAC
administrators.

I think Kronos
moved the
teleportation re-
search equipment
into the reactor
core and plans to
use the massive
of the reactor
core to move
something very
large into our
dimension.

Hey, by the
way, you didn't
hear any of this
from me, OK?

space Corporation

Matt, I've been
transferred to a
unit in charge of
moving a bunch of
machinery from
the labs to the
reactor sector.
Not sure what
that's all about
but I won't be
able to make our
DDR party to-
night. I have to
work overtime.

Dude, the inva-

day after all the
stuff from the
labs were moved
to the reactor
sector. Not sure
what's going on
but I think Gue-
rard may have had
a hand in this.
Heard that Guer-
ard ordered the
move. -Jah

it has to do with

Sorry sir. I was
a little dis-
tracted. I dis-
covered an old
computer game
called DOOM...
it has to be at
least 100 years
old but it's
still surpris-
ingly addictive.
The weird thing
is that the set-
ting and scenario
of the game is
similar to ours.
Funny, eh?

Log Entry of
Dr. Jensen:
*CLASSIFIED*
Our budget has
been increased to
fund the study of
matter transpor-
tation. We hope
to have a func-
tional prototype
ready for demon-
stration in a few
months.

Log Entry of
Dr. Guerard:

Seems that my
colleague, Dr.
Jensen, has been
fired over some
petty security
matters. It's un-
fortunate; he was

Dr. Jensen had me
investigate Dr.
Guerard's employ-
ment history.
What I found was
strange. Guerard
was supposedly
hired onto the
teleportation re-
search team 2
years ago but
UACHQ has no rec-
ord of him.

Log Entry of
Dr. Jensen:

Dr. Guerard says
the electrical
requirements of
our device ex-
ceeded his ini-
tial estimations.
We will likely
have to move the
device to a loca-
tion with a
larger energy
source.

Log Entry of
Dr. Guerard:
*CLASSIFIED*
With Mr. Nadira's
assistance, I was
able to convince
Col. Graff to
move our equip-
ment from the lab
to the reactor.
This move should
help meet the
energy demands of
our next set of
experiments.

This is my last

happened but I
