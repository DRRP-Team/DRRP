Green keycard
north of lab.

You lookin' for
the green key-
card? A guy found
it and put it in
a secure storage
closet north of
the lab.

Mr. Nadira is a
senior resident
at the Biological
Research Facil-
ity. The team was
working on mind
control devices
prior to the in-
vasion.

Nadira's focus
was the canine
neurological re-
search. You can
read his progress
report on the
terminal at the
other side of
this room.

Marine, ignore
the door up ahead
on you right.
That area is un-
der lockdown but
the door may be
unlocked, the
systems are act-
ing up all over.
I suggest you
just move along.

[Dr. Guerard]
Continue down the
hall and ignore

[Mr. Nadira]
You're not
authorized to be
in here, soldier!

Code 741 to lock
the lab door.

[Mr. Nadira]
Hey, are you the
Marine that Dr...
Yeah, maybe I can
help you. You'll
need to check
your weapons
though, firearms
are not allowed
in the lab. I'll
take your weapons
and put them in
this cabinet to
my left.

[Mr. Nadira]
You'll get your
weapons back
later! Use my
code: 741 at the
terminal to lock
the door. We need
to secure the
area.

[Mr. Nadira]
Lock the door be-
hind you! The
code is 741. Your
weapons are in
this cabinet. You
can get them back
later.

[Dr. Guerard]
Marine, you're
going to have to
trust me if you
want to make it
out of here
alive. I'll un-
lock the door for
you.

System offline.

[Mr. Nadira]
I don't have time
for games. I need
your help and
I promise to make
it worth your
while. I have
some technology
that you may find
very useful. You
with me?

[Mr. Nadira]
It's a device
that can control
any of the pos-
sessed dogs and
make them fight
for you. I'll
show you how it
works if you
bring me the de-
vice.

Code 934 to open
the cage contain-
ing the device.

Cage controls are
at the west end
of the lab room.

[Mr. Nadira]
The device is in
a cage at the
center of this
room. Use code
934 on the ter-
minal at the west
end of the room
to open the cage.
Get the device
and bring it to
me. I'll show you
how to use it.
Stay away from
the cages. The
dogs bite.

[Mr. Nadira]
Bring me the de-
vice. I'll show
you how to use
it.

[Mr. Nadira]
I lied! HAHAHA!
My hounds will
help test the
device. Attack!

Bioresearch Lab
Log Entry of
Mr. Nadira: The
latest specimens
we've captured
are marvelous.
Their cunning and
ferocity are a
sight to see. I'm
close to a break-
through in con-
trolling their
behavior.

Log Entry of Mr.
Nadira: The con-
trol device has
yielded remark-
able results: the
canines will
fight and protect
me if I'm being
attacked. Unfor-
tunately, they
die if they take
too much damage.

Log Entry of Mr.
Nadira: The best
thing about the
device is its mo-
bility. It can be
carried in inven-
tory and used
when a canine is
directly in front
of you. The down-
side... it's a
one-use only
device. Fortu-
nately I've du-
plicated several
prototypes and
hid them around
the base. Once a
canine is cap-
tured, it will
protect you and
fight for you
until death.

End of log.

Welcome to Sector
3, home of UAC's
only Mars based
biological re-
search lab.

Everything is
fine here. Just
go back to Junc-
tion. Really.

[Email]
To: P. Marino
From: H. Hancock
Paul, do you know
what's going on
in Sector 3? I
got an emergency
medical call from
them but when I
got there, they
kicked me out de-
nying they ever
made the call! I
heard strange
animal-like
sounds from the
lab as they
booted me out the
door. -Hugh

[Email]
To: H. Hancock
From: P. Marino
Well, some weird
things have been
happening lately.
I did some check-
ing into that
sector and it
turns out there's
some kind of
lockdown - high-
est clearances
only. The thing
is, I've been un-
able to find out
who authorized
it. -Paul

[Email]
To: P. Marino
From: H. Hancock
So... what should
we do? Should we
report this to
someone?
-Hugh

[Email]
To: H. Hancock
From: P. Marino
Report what? It's
over our heads!
Oh, btw, I found
a green keycard
in this sector.
It's in a secure
closet at the
north end of this
sector if anyone
comes looking.
-Paul
