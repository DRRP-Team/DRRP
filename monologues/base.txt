Congratulations!
You've shut down
the portal to
Hell and stopped
the demonic inv-
asion.

You have found
every secret and
killed every mon-
ster in the game.
This calls for a
celebration!
Please visit:

doomrpg.com/sarge


Nice job. There
is only a little
more you need to
do to achieve
Master rank. We
have a parade
for you at:

doomrpg.com/blues


You've beaten the
demons from Hell,
but we've seen
better. Find out
more by visiting:

doomrpg.com/spire


You've finished
the game, barely.
There's still much
to discover. For a
little inspiration
to do better next
time, visit:

Good luck!
