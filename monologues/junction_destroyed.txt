Locked Door

Thank god you're
back! We've suf-
fered a massive
attack! Hordes of
monsters swarmed
into Junction
from the reactor
area.

Go to red zone
and talk to Dr.
Kelvin.

Dr. Kelvin was
able to seal up
the door to the
reactor to stop
the attack. Hope
he's OK... get
down to the reac-
tor entrance in
the red zone and
see if you can
help him.

Ugh, I don't feel
so good...

Oh no...

Find Jensen. Last
seen in north
wing.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Marine! I'm so
glad to see you!
It's been hell
down here. I was
able to lock this
door to stop the
invasion but I'm
not sure what to
do now. Find Dr.
Jensen and see
how we should
proceed... he was
in the north wing
last time I saw
him.

[Dr. Kelvin]
What the hell was
that? I hope Dr.
Jensen is OK. Go
find him.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Go check in with
Dr. Jensen. He is
probably still in
the north wing.

Use passcode 5966
to enter the re-
actor area.

[Dr. Kelvin]
What? Jensen's
dead?! You have
to end this or
we'll all die. Go
in there, the
passcode is 5966.
Godspeed.

[Dr. Kelvin]
5966 will open
the door.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Ugh. One of those
things got inside
me. I can feel
it. Help me!

[Dr. Kelvin]
That computer
terminal controls
the door that
leads to the re-
actor core. Don't
mess with it.

[Dr. Kelvin]
We don't want
that door opening
again.

[Dr. Kelvin]
Whose side are
you on? Leave
that terminal
alone!

[Dr. Kelvin]
Watch out! Here
they come!

Dr. Kelvin is
down at the reac-
tor door entrance
in the red zone.
He wanted to talk
with you.

I'm guarding this
position to pre-
vent any more
monsters from
getting into
Junction.

The entrance to
the north wing
just collapsed!
Dr. Jensen was in
there. I hope
he's- uh, what is
happening to me?
Ahhhhh!

I'm so scared...

We're all gonna
die! Don't you
get it?! We have
to get out of
here!

I feel a tingling
sensation. What
is going on?
Ahhhhh!

Look at the car-
nage! I don't
think anyone made
it out alive!

I'm too late to
help any of these
people, but let
me at least help
you...

Health restored.

Good luck,
Marine.

I'm knee-deep in
the dead.

What? The passage
to the north wing
is blocked?
You'll probably
just have to find
another way in.

Sorry. I don't
have any more
Medkits. I used
my last one on
you.

Please! Don't let
them hurt me!

They are coming
for us.

I'm hit!

Argh! Damn it!

[Dr. Jensen]
Marine, How'd you
get in here? I
thought this room
was cut off from
Junction when the
ceiling caved in.
I'm OK, but I
have bad news...

[Dr. Jensen]
Guerard reopened
the portal. He
brought the reac-
tor back online
to reopen the
link with Hell.
According to what
I've found, Dr.
Guerard intends
to bring Kronos's
creation, the Cy-
berdemon, into
our dimension...

Head down to the
reactor area in
the red zone.

We must make
every effort to
prevent this from
happening. Have
Dr. Kelvin open
the door to the
reactor. Head
down there and
destroy the por-
tal. You are our
only hope.

Uh oh.

Goodbye, Marine.

I'm going to kill
you... slowly.
-Kronos

System offline.

I have plans for
you, Marine. Meet
me at the reac-
tor.
-Kronos

They stopped me
years ago but
they can't stop
me this time.
-Kronos
