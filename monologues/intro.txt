You picked up a
Medkit. Access
your inventory
menu and use it
to restore health
if you become se-
verely wounded.

The fire extin-
guisher will put
out fires.

Use the fire ex-
tinguisher to put
out fires that
have broken out
throughout the
base. Some fires
will block your
path. You can
walk through them
but it will hurt
you.

Use Medkits to
restore health.

If you get low on
health try using
a Medkit. You may
have one in your
inventory. To use
an item, access
inventory menu,
select the item,
and press the OK
button. You can
use items during
combat.

Where are all the
Marines in your
unit?... What?
They only sent
you? We're
doomed!

Move out, Marine!

Use axe to chop
down jammed
doors.

You'll need the
Axe to chop down
jammed doors.

You can switch
between the axe
and other weapons
by accessing your
inventory menu,
or cycle through
your weapons by
pressing the *
and 7 keys. Use
the axe to chop
down jammed doors
or zombies; it's
effective for
close combat.

What year was the
original DOOM
released?

Door unlocked.

Keep talking to
the Marine near
the locked door.

The Marine will
eventually unlock
the door if you
keep talking with
him.

The door to your
right is locked,
but I can open it
if you'll stay
and talk to me
for a bit.

Hey, did you know
you can switch
weapons and use
items from your
inventory menu?
You can also
switch between
weapons by press-
ing the * and 7
buttons.

I get lost wan-
dering around
this base so the
automap is useful
for finding my
way around. The
automap is stan-
dard military is-
sue so you should
already have one.
Access your auto-
map by pressing
the # key, or
from the game
menu. You get to
the game menu by
pressing the 0
key.

Sometimes you can
talk with people
and use computers
more than once.
This can be very
helpful. Well,
thanks for the
chat. I'll unlock
the door now. Oh,
one last thing,
you should pro-
bably save your
game before con-
tinuing. Get in
the habit of sav-
ing regularly.
You can save and
load games from
the game menu.

The door should
be unlocked now.
Move out. I'll
meet up with you
at Junction.

Try talking to
people or using
computers more
than once for
additional infor-
mation.

Reports indicate
some monsters are
weak against cer-
tain types of
weapons.

All available
combat personnel
report to Junc-
tion!

Use Medkits in
your inventory to
restore health.
Your inventory
list is accessi-
ble from the game
menu. Access the
game menu by
pressing the 0
key.

The yellow door
to the east of
this room re-
quires the yellow
keycard to open.
It's the only way
out of this area
so find the yel-
low keycard!

Lost already?!
Use your automap.
Duh!

You got the
yellow keycard.
That's nice.

[Combat Guide]
Tip 103: Crates
can be smashed
with weapons and
often contain
useful items. Be-
ware, some crates
explode if dis-
turbed.

[Combat Guide]
Tip 104: Your
automap is avail-
able from the
game menu. Use it
to help you if
you're lost.

Incoming message:
RED ALERT! Base
is under attack!
Combat personnel
report to Junc-
tion for further
instructions.

Signal lost.

Computer stations
such as this are
all over the
base. Check them
for information.

Some computers
will prompt for a
numeric passcode.
Use your numeric
keypad to enter
the number.

Useful informa-
tion you acquire
will be automat-
ically written
down in your
notebook which is
available from
the inventory
menu.

Hello, Marine.
Welcome to Mars!
Walk over an item
to pick it up.
Access the inven-
tory menu to
switch weapons
or use items.

Use your weapons
to smash open
crates. Crates
often contain
useful items.

Health vials are
small blue bot-
tles that in-
stantly restore
some of your
health when you
walk over them.
They can be found
throughout the
base.

This computer
contains map info
for this sector
which can be
downloaded to
your automap. Ac-
cess your automap
from the game
menu.

Now that you have
the map data,
you'll find your
way around easily
with the automap.

Some walls are
secret doors to
rooms containing
equipment. Be on
the lookout for
them. They look
slightly differ-
ent than normal
walls. People or
computers can oc-
casionally give
you info about
the secret doors'
location.

The axe is good
for battling Zom-
bies at close
combat but inef-
fective for long
distance attacks.
Use other weapons
for long dis-
tances. The fire
extinguisher is
great for fires
but not mon-
sters... unless
they're on fire.

La-la-la.

Secret door be-
tween yellow
lamps.

There's a secret
door between the
two yellow lamps.

Shutting down...

I changed the
door passcode to
1234. I know it
isn't a good
passcode. I was
in a rush.

What a horrible

so simple I don't
even have to
write it down in
my notebook.

Hey Smith, though
some people can

Enter passcode to
unlock door:


What is the pass-
code for the
door? Perhaps we
can find it on
another computer
terminal.

Oh, you found the
passcode? If you
ever forget it
you can always
check your note-
book.

1234? Great pass-
code! Freaking
idiots!

The door to your
left is locked
and I don't have
the passcode to
unlock it. You'll
need to get the
passcode. Enter
it in the com-
puter at your
right.

Passcodes you
find will be
automatically
written in your
notebook. Access
the inventory
menu if you need
to check your
notebook.

The passcode is
1234?! Passcodes
like that are in
direct violation
of Code 12 of the
UAC Security Pro-
tocol Handbook!
Doesn't anyone
read the handbook
anymore?

There's a vicious
monster east of
here. I suggest
you head south
and look for the
yellow keycard in
a room over
there. Now might
also be a good
time to save
your game. Re-
member to save
your game often
so that you don't
have to replay a
bunch of it if
you die!

Go south. Trust
me!

I can't believe
you went in
there! You are
lucky to be
alive!

Looks like you
got the yellow
keycard. Go back
to the yellow
door and head to
Junction!

I hope we make
it out of here
alive!

I don't feel like
talking.

I'm really busy.
Go away.

Leave me alone!

Dude...

Secret door near
barrels blocking
yellow keycard
room.

All right! Near
the three barrels
blocking the yel-
low keycard room
you'll find a se-
cret door. That's
all I know. Now
leave me alone!

...

I'm glad you're
here, Marine. A
horde of monsters
have been let
loose by an evil
presence. Be
careful!

Good luck!

Get rid of those
barrels to get to
that door. Try
shooting them at
a distance to
clear them out.
The barrels are
volatile so be
careful.

You can use ex-
ploding barrels
to damage mon-
sters. Cool, eh?

Showed those bar-
rels, heh?

Yeah...
