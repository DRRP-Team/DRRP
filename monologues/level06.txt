Why? The rest of

requirements are
being met at the

location.

You will order

Dr. Guerard came
through here a
while ago. He
seemed to be in
quite a hurry. A
few minutes later
Dr. Jensen came
in looking for
him. Jensen
looked very wor-
ried. What is
going on?

Power routing
controls for the
base are found up
ahead in this
sector. I think
that is where
Guerard was
headed.

Did you see Dr.
Jensen chasing
after Dr. Gue-
rard? What is go-
ing on with those
two?

I think I may
know what it's
about. I saw some
classified doc-
uments that seem
to indicate that
Guerard did some-
thing to get Jen-
sen fired. UAC
higher ups seem
to know about it
but aren't doing
anything.
Strange, eh?

I hope Jensen
kicks Guerard's
butt. Guerard de-
serves to get his
butt kicked. I
hate that smug
slimeball.

[Dr. Jensen]
Hey, Marine! I've
been pursuing
Guerard but I
don't know which
door he went
through. Both
doors are locked
and I am working
on the computer
trying to get
them opened. Give
me a minute...

Catch Guerard.

[Dr. Jensen]
Ok. I've unlocked
the first door.
You explore that
direction and
I'll try to get
this other door
opened. We will
meet up later.
Find Guerard and
stop him from do-
ing whatever it
is he is trying
to do!

[Dr. Jensen]
The first door is
open. You take
it. I'll take the
other path as
soon as I get the
second door open.
Don't wait for
me. We'll meet up
later.

The combatants in
this area are
very dangerous.
I'll provide es-
cort for Jensen.
Be careful!

We're trying to
catch Dr. Gue-
rard. We fear he
is up to no good.

Marine, I got the
other door opened
and we are pursu-
ing Dr Guerard.
We'll meet up
soon.
-Dr. Jensen

[Dr. Jensen]
Look! On your
left! Get him!

[Dr. Jensen]
Keep the pace up.
We must catch
Guerard.

I've got your
back!

[Dr. Jensen]
There he is!
Up ahead on the
right!

[Dr. Jensen]
I'm getting too
old for this.

Keep moving!

[Dr. Jensen]
There! To your
left!

[Dr. Jensen]
I'm not sure what
Guerard is up to,
but it is proba-
bly very bad.

He sure is fast.

[Dr. Jensen]
He's getting
away!

[Dr. Jensen]
No time to chat.
We need to catch
Guerard.

He got away
again!

[Dr. Jensen]
There he is!
Straight ahead!

I'll cover Dr.
Jensen.

Door unlocked.

Guerard went
through this
door. You go
first. I'll pro-
tect Dr. Jensen.

Lock and load!

[Dr. Jensen]
The control cen-
ter is just up
ahead. Whatever
Dr. Guerard is up
to, he must be
stopped!

[Dr. Jensen]
After you,
Marine.

I'll follow you
and provide cover
for Dr. Jensen.

Dr. Guerard went
through this door
just minutes ago.

[System offline]

[Dr. Jensen]
We almost had
him! Guerard went
this way. He must
be headed to the
Control Room. You
lead. I'll follow
behind with the
other Marine.
I've unlocked the
door. Let's move!

[Dr. Jensen]
Let's go!
We must catch Dr.
Guerard!

Power low. Termin-
al in sleep mode.

Door opened.

Damn! One of
those demons hurt
me pretty bad.
You go on. I'll
catch up when I
can.

Head through the
door. You must
stop Guerard!

[Dr. Guerard]
New circuit con-
figuration com-
plete. Rerouting
power... Oh!
Hello, Marine.
You're too late.
I just brought
the main reactor
back online.
Nothing can stop
me now.

[Dr. Guerard]
Mr. Nadira,
please dispose of
him.

[Dr. Guerard]
...

[Dr. Jensen]
Great, you have
the BFG. Now we
need to find the
red keycard to
access the reac-
tor. Security
logs on this com-
puter indicate
there's a red
keycard in Sector
7. Head there im-
mediately. I'll
catch up with you
later. The exit
to Junction is
east of this po-
sition. Good
luck.

[Dr. Jensen]
Head for sector 7
to retrieve the
red keycard. With
it we can access
the reactor area
and stop Dr.
Guerard!

[Mr. Nadira]
So we meet again.
This time you
won't escape so
easily.

[Dr. Guerard]
Mr. Nadira, your
assistance has
been invaluable.
Marine, I really
couldn't have
done all of this
without you. But
now, you're both
liabilities to
me.

[Dr. Guerard]
See you in Hell.

[Mr. Nadira]
No, wait!

[Mr. Nadira]
Argh!

Power rerouted.
Geothermic reac-
tor online.

[Dr. Jensen]
Hey Marine! I
made it.

BFG Storage Clo-
set passcode is

Have fun.

[Dr. Jensen]
I finally caught
up with you. Did
Guerard get away?
He must have used
his teleporter.
Looks like Gue-
rard intends to
reopen the portal
now that the re-
actor is back on-
line. We're going
to have to go
down there to
stop him. We need
a plan. Let me
think...

[Dr. Jensen]
Ok, first, let's
get some big
guns. Check the
computer again
and see if you
can get that BFG
storage closet
open.

[Dr. Jensen]
Check the com-
puter for more
information.

[Dr. Guerard]
HAHAHA!

[Dr. Jensen]
It's a trap! Run
for your life!

Take cover!

ARGH! I'm hit!

There are too
many!

[Dr. Jensen]
I ran in here for
cover. I'm pretty
hurt so I'm not
sure I'll be able
to go on with
you.

[Dr. Jensen]
There must be a
computer switch
to unlock that
door somewhere
around here...

[Dr. Jensen]
Don't worry about
me. I'll be fine.
Just stop
Guerard!
